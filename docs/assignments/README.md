# MAD9022 Assignments

## Cordova Projects <Badge text="40% of Final Grade"/>

- There are six Cordova Projects which can be completed.
- Each of the Cordova Projects is worth 10 marks out of the possible total of 40.
- You can submit any number of the projects to improve your grade.
- If you submit three projects that are worth 10/10 and you are happy with 30/40 as your percentage for this part of the grade then you can stop there.
- If you want to continue doing more and submitting them, then you can add to your grade by submitting up to six projects.
- You could get 6/10 on each of the six submissions and that would give you a total of 36/40. Alternatively you could get 9/10 on only four submissions and that would also give you a total of 36/40.
- 40/40 marks is the maximum that you can get for this part of the grade.
- So, you can gain grades through quantity OR quality.
