## API Assignment

This will be a joint assignment with a partner. You and a partner of your choosing will be building a whole full-stack solution. The API portion will be built for MAD9124. The front-end interface will be built for MAD9022.

Please send an email to both Steve **griffis@algonquincollege.com** and Robert **mckennr@algonquincollege.com** to tell us who your partner for the final project will be.

The details and requirements for the API will be covered in MAD9124. The functionality of the API will be graded in that course. The front-end functionality, design, and usability will be graded in MAD9022.

**More details coming soon**
