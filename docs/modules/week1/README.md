# MAD9022 - Introduction

## GitHub Usernames

We need to standardize all the GitHub accounts. Everyone's user accounts on GitHub need to be set to the same as your Algonquin Username.

Go to the GitHub.com website and click on your avatar. Click on the `Settings` link in the menu. Next click on the `Account` link in the left hand menu. Finally, click on the `Change username` button.

## Course Deliverables

### Quizzes

Most weeks there will be a verbal quiz in class. Each correctly answered question is worth 4 points. You can answer up to 2 questions per class. After answering 5 questions you will have earned your 20%.


### Timed Exercises

There are five in-class timed exercises. The topic will be announced in class, during the preceeding class, to give you a chance to prepare. Each exercise needs to be completed in 30 minutes. These exercises will test your ability to research a problem and come up with a quick solution before a close deadline. The actual exercise will only be revealed at the start of the exercise period.


### Cordova Projects

There are 6 Cordova Projects available for you to complete. You can do them in any order but you have a limited window of time for each submission.

There is a minimum set of requirements that you need to meet for each app before you can submit each app.


### Assignments

There are two assignments, one at the start of the semester (HTML Canvas Charts) and a joint one at the end of the semester (API).


### Practice Exercises

At the bottom of the assignments page there is a link to a series of practice JavaScript exercises. These are not worth any marks but doing them will help you be prepared for the Timed Exercises.


## Plagiarism vs Collaboration

We want to encourage all students to collaborate with each other. Explaining concepts and techniques to each other is beneficial for all. Everyone has different skills, strengths, and background experience. Sharing that knowledge has a positive impact on the class and the course.

Plagiarism is just copying work that is done by someone else without making the effort yourself. Whether you are actually taking a copy of someone else's file, or you are just looking at another screen and typing out what they have written - this is plagiarism. 

Submitting plagiarized work will get you a zero on the plagiarized assignment. A second incidence of plagiarism will get you a zero on the course.

## Program Assignment Late Policy

The MAD&D program has a standard late policy. Late assignments will receive a 10% late penalty for each day they are late. The maximum penalty is 30%. However, after 10 days the assignment is worth zero. 

Extensions may be given for valid reasons, if requested more than one day before the due date.


## Program Assistants and Open Lab Hours

We have Program Assistants again this semester to help students in level 2. The PAs will be in class helping in MAD9021, MAD9022, and MAD9124.

We also have open lab hours :clock2: Thursday and Friday from 11am to 12pm. There will be a Program Assistant in the lab during these two hours to help anyone looking for assistance with any course work.


## Git from CLI

This semester we will be using Git for most of our work. We will be using it from the Command Line.

[Basic Git CLI Instructions](./git.md)


## NodeJS and NPM from CLI

We will be using Node and NPM for many tasks this semester, not least of which will be Cordova.

[Basic Node and NPM](./npm.md)

You will get more instruction on Node and NPM in MAD9124.

## Yarn Package Manager

There is an alternative to NPM called Yarn. Yarn can run alongside NPM without any problems. Both are package managers. Both will create their own .lock file to keep track of the currently used versions of the installed module dependencies.

You can use either one or both on any project. They will both update the `package.json` file.

[Yarn Package Manager](./yarn.md)


## VS Code

One of the new tools that we will be using this semester is VS Code, instead of Brackets.

[VS Code basics](./vscode.md)


## HTML Canvas

HTML5 introduced a new element that can be used to draw graphics programmatically. You can add text, images, or even video content onto the Canvas. You can render graphics in 2D or 3D on the Canvas element.
