# Node and NPM

You will be learning a lot about Node and NPM in MAD9124 this semester but I want you to have a basic reference for the things that we will be doing with them too.

When you install NodeJS from [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/) you will also get NPM and NPX installed too.

## Creating a Node Project

Once you have created the folder for your project through `Finder` or `Windows Explorer` or with `mkdir` on the command line, you should navigate to that folder in the Terminal or Command Prompt.

We can then turn the folder into one that is managed by NPM like this:

```
npm init -y
```

This will create a file called `package.json` which will hold all the information about your project: the version number, the name, the starting point, a list of all dependencies (other code that you project relies on), and scripts that you can run from the command line to help manage your project.
