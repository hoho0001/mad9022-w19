# Visual Studio Code

This semester we will be using VS Code as our development environment instead of Brackets.

It has many advantages like integrated Emmet, Integrated Git support, and an Integrated Terminal.

## Download

You can download VS Code for OSX or Windows from [the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Official Documentation

Here are the official [Guides for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs?start=true)

## Extensions

Just like in Brackets, there are hundreds of Extensions available for VS Code. VS Code comes with many common ones installed.

To view the installed ones or search for new ones, click the bottom square icon in the left hand menu. Then you can click the three dots at the top of the list of extensions to see all the options.
