# 10. HTML5 APIs

## Screen Orientation API

When a mobile device is held different ways, the orientation of the screen is changed between portrait and landscape. The left or right side of the screen may be at the top. By default the device takes care of rotating content. However, you can write media queries to change the layout when this happens.

You can also have JavaScript functions that are triggered to run when the change in screen orientation happens.

## Vibration API

Want to use vibration to notify a user that something is happening? The Vibration API has your back. While slightly different in it's implementation between iOS and Android, it still works for both.

## Network Information APIs

There are events for online and offline. While they don't always work perfectly they can be useful.

There is also a Network information API under development to help us get information about the user's connection so that we can provide a better experience.

## Fullscreen API

The Fullscreen API lets us programmatically control making a page fill the whole screen. For security reasons the functionality has to be triggered by a user-initiated event like a click.
