# Dataset Properties in HTML Elements

## Dataset Property

The Javascript dataset property that allows us to access attributes from the HTML which begin with data- does not work properly with all versions of Android. Versions 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 have only partial support for this property.

So, if you are looking to support Android phones versions 2.1 and up then we need an alternate method. We can use the getAttribute and setAttribute methods.

The dataset method would be:

```js
let p = document.createElement("p");
p.dataset.info = 123;
console.log(p.dataset.info); //will output the value 123.
```

The get/set attribute alternative is:

```js
let p = document.createElement("p");
p.setAttribute("data-info", 123);
console.log( p.getAttribute("data-info");
```

If we were writing the HTML with the data- property already inside it then we would write something like this.

```html
<p data-info="123">Some text in a paragraph.</p>
```

This is an extremely useful capability.

It means that we can use attributes that we make up to store any information we want.

We can add properties to any element that we read through Javascript which will let us decide how to update or alter the interface of our application.

We can add values that we collect from a user into the interface to be used later.

We can add values that we extract from a JSON file or XML file, again, to be used later.
