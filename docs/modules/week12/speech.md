# HTML5 Speech API

There are two parts to the HTML5 Speech API. First is the speech-to-text, which listens to a user and converts what they are saying into text on the screen. Second is the text-to-speech, which converts written text into audio output.

Browser support for text-to-speech is quite good. However, support for speech-to-text is still quite limited. See the links in the Reference section below.
