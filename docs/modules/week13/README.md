## Web Share API

Another recent API in the browser is the Web Share API. This is intended to be used to let users share things with a standard interface and experience.

## Web Workers

JavaScript is a single thread programming language. However, Web Workers give us the ability to start another thread to run tasks in the background. We can use a messaging system to pass events and data between the web page and the web worker.
