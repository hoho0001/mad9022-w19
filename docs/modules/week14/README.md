# 14. Service Workers, QR Codes, Maps, Sets, and Template Strings

## QR Codes

QR Codes are a two dimensional bar code for storing information. They can hold numbers, strings, UPC codes, or even URLs. We can read them from mobile devices using the Camera and a plugin. We can even generate them with JavaScript.

## ES6 Maps and Sets

Maps and Sets are new datatypes added to JavaScript as part of the ES6 update. You can think of them as specialized Arrays and Objects.

## Template Strings

Another new feature in ES6 are Template Strings. They let us create strings that have embedded variables. They make it much easier to concatenate strings and variables. They also have some other cool more advanced features.

## Service Workers

Service workers are similar to Web workers in that they run in their own thread. They can run in the background but they also act as an intermediary between a webpage and the network. They can intercept requests for any web resource and they can allow webpages to run in an `offline` mode.

They are a key component to PWA Progressive Web Apps.
