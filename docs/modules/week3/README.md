# Cordova Configuration

## Installing Cordova

We use [NPM](https://npmjs.com) to install Cordova. With `Node JS` installed, we can run the npm commands from the command line and we can install Cordova as a global package on our computer, both OSX and Windows. Alternatively you could use the `Yarn Package Manager` to install it.

```
npm i -g cordova
yarn global add cordova
```

Keep an eye on the current version of Cordova. You will likely want to update the version that you have installed globally. We can do this from the CLI with either `NPM` or `Yarn`.

```
npm update -g cordova
yarn global update cordova
```
