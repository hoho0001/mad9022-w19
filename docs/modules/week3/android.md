# Setting Up for Android

## Common Setup Requirements

To be able to develop Android applications there are a number of things that you need to have installed and prepared regardless of whether you are doing Android native, Cordova, NativeScript, Xamarin or ReactNative.

1. Android Studio IDE - when you install this, you will get the basic Android SDK
2. JDK - Java Developer Kit. This is **NOT** the same thing as the JRE (Java RunTime Environment). You need the JDK to compile your Android apps. For Cordova we need version 8.x.x of the JDK.
3. Android SDK updates to APIs and tools. For each version of Android - KitKat, Marshmallow, Nougat, Oreo, etc. there is an individual API. For all the build tools and supporting code there are multiple things to update.
4. Updating your Environmental Variables to indicate where the JDK and SDK are installed as well as the location for the various tools for the SDK.
5. AVDs - Android Virtual Devices are the different version files for each Emulator that you would run. An AVD contains things like screen size, memory, Android API version, and device capabilities. When the emulator runs it needs one of these files to know how it is supposed to behave. Think of them as the Operating System for your emulator.
6. Android Devices with the development options turned on.
