## Learning to Write Markdown

MarkDown is a great simple syntax for writing documentation. When you create a new GitHub Repo you are always prompted to create a `README.md` file. The `.md` files are MarkDown files. It is an easy syntax to use and provides nearly all the functionality that the first version of HTML did.

Actually, this whole website is built using MarkDown for the content. A JavaScript framework called [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) that uses the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) library to convert the MarkDown into HTML and add some custom CSS.

## Throwing and Catching Errors and Exceptions

All that red text that you have seen in the browser console is just the `message` property values from `Error` objects. You can create your own custom `Error` objects for your code and you can also use `Error Event` listeners as well as `try...catch` statements to capture and handle the errors without crashing your webpage.
