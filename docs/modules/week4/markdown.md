# MarkDown

You've been writing HTML MarkUp for a while now, so let's start talking about MarkDown.

The README.md file that you have been adding to your GitHub repos all this time is a MarkDown file.

The biggest rule to follow is to always put a blank line between each of the elements. Extra carriage returns will be condensed into a single blank line, so don't worry about having too many.

Here are a few of the common elements in a basic MarkDown file.

```md
# This is an H1

## This is an H2

### This is an H3

This bunch of text is a paragraph

- these are items
- in an unordered list

1. these are items
2. in an ordered list

![this is an image alt text](./the-image-url.png)

[This is a link. The text goes here](./the-url-goes-here.html)
```
