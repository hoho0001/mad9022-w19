# 5. Cordova, Prototypes, Closures, Currying & Event Loop

## Closures and Currying

Closures are a key feature of JavaScript. It is not something that you have to start adding to your code. Rather, it is something that already exists which you need to be aware of. You need to recognize them and understand when your code needs to be structured in a way that creates them.

Once you understand Closures, which can take a few attempts, then you can start to use Currying with your functions. This is a great way to save code and write small dynamic reusable functions.

## Object Prototypes

The inheritance model in JS uses Prototypes instead of Classes. Despite the fact that JS does now have a `class` keyword, JS does not use real Classes. There are actually a number of different ways that you can create Objects in JavaScript, and they all involve Prototypes.

## Default Function Parameters

Starting with ES6, we can provide default values for parameters in our functions. JavaScript functions have always allowed you to send whatever values you want to functions, regardless of whether there are named parameters in the function declaration or not. Conversely, you can have named parameters and pass nothing to them. Now we can set default values for parameters that are sent nothing.

## JavaScript Event Loop

The JavaScript Event Loop is the internal process by which the JavaScript engine decides which order to run your commands. NodeJS uses this too.

## Working with Files in Cordova

In Cordova Apps, files can be inside the www folder or they can be located elsewhere in the project structure.

## Working with Media in Cordova

Cordova has a Media plugin to help you work with audio and video files in your app.
