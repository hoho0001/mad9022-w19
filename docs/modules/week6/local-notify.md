## Local Notifications

Local Notifications are the system notifications that the device will display to the user. You can have your app display a notice at any time, or schedule ones that will appear at a later time.

These are not **PUSH Notifications**. They do not originate on the server. They are like reminders from your app. Use them sparingly. While they can be effective at reminding the user about your application, if you have too many notifications that disturb the user then they may decide to uninstall your application.

There are a number of these plugins for creating the local notifications. This is NOT a core feature of Cordova. This is NOT a core plugin from cordova. We will be using one from GitHub by the user [@katzer](https://github.com/katzer).
