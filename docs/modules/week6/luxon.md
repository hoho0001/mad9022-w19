# Luxon Time Library

## The Evolution of Moment.js

There is a library for working with Time and Dates in JavaScript which has been the most used library for enhancing what vanilla JavaScript can do. It is known as `Moment.js`. [MomentJS Library](http://momentjs.com/).  There is a second JavaScript library that needs to be added if you want to include support for all the World's timezones and languages [Moment Timezone](http://momentjs.com/timezone/).

Unfortunately, it does not support many of the new International Features that browsers now support for time and dates that are localized.

So, Luxon was created by one of the developers who worked on the `Moment.js` project as an updated version for modern browsers. [Luxon Library](https://moment.github.io/luxon/). It works without having to add the timezone JavaScript library.
