# HTML5 Web Notifications API

Web Notifications are one of the new HTML5 APIs. They are similar to the Cordova Local Notifications plugin. They are a way that you can prompt a user for permission to display pop-up notices to them even if the website is no longer displayed in a tab. As long as the browser is open it can display a notification.

We can use the Web Notification API to show reminders to users about things on our website. They can also be used in conjunction with Push Notifications that come from the server.
