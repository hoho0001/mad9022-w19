# 7. Geolocation & Google Maps

## Geolocation

When you want to find the latitude and longitude of a user, the `navigator.geolocation` object is what we use. This is one of the HTML5 APIs.

It can be used in combination with Cordova or with Google Maps for even more functionality.

## Google Maps

### Introduction to Google Maps

To work with the Google Maps API (Javascript version) we need to register for a developer key and then learn how to create the `Map` objects and work with all their properties.

### Google Maps Controls

Every interactive Google Map has many controls that can be placed on the map. This like zoom, pan, scale, and street view.

### Google Maps Events

Just like the DOM has events to enable us to listen for user interactions, the Google Map API also has a set of custom events that we can use to listen for user interactions with the maps we create.

### Google Maps Markers

When you want to add `Markers` or `InfoWindows` to the map, the Google Maps API has methods and properties that we can use to create these.

## Cordova Geolocation

In order to work with Geolocation in a Cordova app, we need to add the Geolocation plugin to make sure that we have the necessary permissions on the mobile device.

## ES6 Rest and Spread Operators

As part of ES6, a new `...` operator was added to JavaScript. It is actually two operators in one - Rest and Spread.

## Cordova Status Bars

Cordova has a core plugin for controlling the appearance of the statusbar in mobile apps.
