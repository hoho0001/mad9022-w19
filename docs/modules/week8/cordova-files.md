# Cordova File Plugin

Details on how to use the Cordova file plugin to manage files and folders.

The Cordova File plugin provides a bunch of properties that point to commonly used folders. This way you will have access to a common set of folder regardless of whether your App is running on iOS or Android.

```
cordova.file.applicationStorageDirectory
cordova.file.applicationDirectory
cordova.file.cacheDirectory
cordova.file.dataDirectory
cordova.file.externalApplicationStorageDirectory
```
